To run this code, the file needs to be uploaded into the google colab environment and run step by step. It is a time series predictor which predicts the number of rental electric bikes used per day. We used the dataset which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset. In the code under the comment "#parameters", we can change the various hyperparameters to see how they affect the results as well.
