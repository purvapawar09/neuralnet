To run this code, the file needs to be uploaded into the google colab environment and run step by step. It is a K-means clustering of a dataset consisting of various different tweets. The number of clusters can be altered by changing the value of k under the comment "# value of K" towards the end of the file. The number of experiments run can be changed from 5 by altering the value assigned to variable numexp towards the end of the file as well. The default results show the output from running 5 experiments of k-mean clusters of varying sizes and the SSE value for each.
