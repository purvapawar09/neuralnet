Machine Learning Assignment 1

Part 1: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v45JLMaulrhn1SCLTR_XAIzPaGSvgNh3?usp=sharing Part 1 utilizes a self-made linear regression function with gradient descent to train the data and predict the temperature metric. To run the code for part one, it needs to be uploaded to google colab and run step by step. If any changes are made to the number of iterations or the learning rate, the entire file needs to be run all over again to run without errors.

Part 2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/199RhwdMA9SPYSB1LNd7ku0E1RVh__l3Y?usp=sharing Part 2 utilizes the built in Scikit learn library to predict the temperature metric based on air conditions. To run this code, it also needs to be uploaded to google colab and run step by step. It computes the r^2 and mse metrics to get information about the data.
